nxn grid every cell will represent a square unit of territory, a country
can have more than 1

we can add numbers to the countries so the matrix would look smth like this:
0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2,
0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2,
0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2,
0, 3, 3, 1, 4, 4,
0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4,


----
init
----

init every country with a random variable extracted from the dist for each
of the following things:
- territory
- population
- population growth
- income per capita
- literacy rate
- military spending by % of GDP

also, from a random normally distributed variable you will get
- government rate: value between 1 and 0, the stronger it is, the more
  repressive it gets, the weaker the harder to deal with internal issues

total income: population * income per capita

------
growth
------

every month update the population by 1/12 of the population grow rate and then
update country total income

-------------
war mechanics
-------------

every day check if triggers has been activated. left to right, then top to
bottom. if war has already started can not start another one.

every time war starts log it.

triggers
-------------
- income
- population density

based on world distributions.

we will use the income and population density of the whole world in order to
build distributions, and get the mean and standard deviation

INCOME_THREASHOLD and POP_THREASHOLD, to fine tune the triggers

income trigger
--------------
- if 2 neighbours countries reach a diff of INCOME_THRESHOLD times de std
  deviation of the world income a conflict will arise WITHIN country. Country
  has strong gov then conflict withheld

- if neighbour country total income is within one std deviation of owns, then
  foreign country will launch the war

population trigger
------------------

if population density reaches one std dev above the median of the region, a
conflict will be triggered in order to look for further territory.

it will select the neighbour with the lowest income to attack

conflict
--------
battles are decided by CWI. each square in combat will calculate it.

CW = TI * GR * LR * MS * LK
TI = country's total income
GR = government rate
LR = literacy rate
MS = military spending
LK = luck

internal conflict
-----------------
fixme

casualties
----------
calc the death toll on both sides
DF = (CWI-)/(CWI+)
CWI- of lossing side
CWI+ of winner side
DF should be between 0 and 1

multiply DF with the population density of the losing country and subtract from
the country population

the winner use
Casualties = (1 - DF)(DF)(PD+)

outcomes
--------

when a side looses that territory is annexed to the country that won
